Bank Loan Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of bank loans to classify them as either Good Loans or Bad Loans. The dataset is stored in an Excel file, which includes various factors such as borrower details, loan amount, and repayment status. This project aims to provide insights into the characteristics that contribute to good or bad loans, helping financial institutions make informed lending decisions.
Contents of the Excel File
The Excel file contains the following key components:
•	Borrower Information: Personal details of the loan applicants, including their credit history, employment status, and income levels.
•	Loan Attributes: Loan amount, interest rate, loan duration, and other key financial indicators.
•	Loan Status: The classification of each loan as either a Good Loan (likely to be repaid on time) or a Bad Loan (at risk of default).
The data has been pre-processed for further analysis and visualizations.
Features
•	Loan Classification: Distinguishes between Good Loans and Bad Loans based on borrower attributes and loan details.
•	Data Visualization: Graphs and charts to help visualize the distribution of good vs. bad loans and identify key trends.
•	Statistical Analysis: Insights into loan performance, such as default rates and key factors influencing loan outcomes.
Instructions for Use
1.	Open the Excel File: The primary dataset is in the Excel file attached.
2.	Analyze Data: Use the built-in formulas, pivot tables, and charts to explore the data and derive insights.
3.	Modify Parameters: You can experiment with different parameters (e.g., loan amount, borrower credit score) to observe their impact on loan classification.
Objectives
•	Improve Loan Approval Strategies: By understanding the factors that make a loan good or bad, financial institutions can optimize their approval processes.
•	Risk Mitigation: This project helps in minimizing the risks of loan defaults by identifying high-risk loans early in the process.
•	Decision Support: Provides a foundation for developing machine learning models or further statistical models for predicting loan performance.
Tech Stack
•	Microsoft Excel: For data handling, processing, and visualization.
Future Enhancements
•	Machine Learning Integration: Future updates could involve applying machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict loan status.
•	Advanced Visualizations: Incorporating more advanced charts and dashboards for better data exploration.
